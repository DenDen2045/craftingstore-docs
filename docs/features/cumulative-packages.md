#Cumulative packages

When creating your category, you can enable "Cumulative packages", this feature allows you to give users discounts based on the packages they bought earlier.

Let's say you have 3 packages on your store;

Rank A: 10 USD  
Rank B: 20 USD  
Rank C: 30 USD  
  
And the player "example" bought "Rank A", then the next time the player visits your store, he will see the following;   
  
Rank A: Unavailable  
Rank B: 20 USD 10 USD   
Rank C: 30 USD 20 USD  
  
This way the player can just upgrade their rank, without paying extra for it.

##### Respect sale calculation

Lets say, you have two packages, rank A: 10 USD, and rank B: 20 USD

The user already bought rank A for the full 10 USD (so they will basically have a gift-card for 10 USD).

So now, if you'll add a 50% discount to rank B, the new price for this rank will be 10 USD. Just like a sale in a real store would.

When the user that already bought rank A comes along, and sees that rank B only costs 10 USD now, they can buy it for free. Because they return their Rank A (they will get their 10 USD back). And with that 10 USD, they order the new rank, Rank B.

\---  
**Note**: The respect sale option also works the other way around, so if rank A would have a 50% discount, and the player buys it for 5 USD, then they will have 5 USD to spend towards another rank, even if the sale ends. They will be able to return their item for the price they bought it for.

**Note**: Subscriptions do not support cumulative packages, if you want to offer subscriptions, then you cannot enable this feature.
