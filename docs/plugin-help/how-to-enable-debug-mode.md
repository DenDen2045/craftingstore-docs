#How to enable debug mode?

**Spigot/CraftBukkit/BungeeCord:**  
1) Open the config located in /plugins/CraftingStore/config.yml  
2\) Add the line: debug: true to the end of the file, under the other config options.  
3\) Save the config and restart your server.

**SpongePowered:**  
1) Open the config located in /config/craftingstore/craftingstore.conf  
2\) Add debug mode to the config like so:  
```
{api-key: test, debug: true}  
```
3\) Save the config and restart your server.

Now your server will start printing more relevant information to the console.
